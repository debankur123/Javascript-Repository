# Javascript functions are used for reusability of code and performance
    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
    A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
    A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

    Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

    The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
    (parameter1, parameter2, ...)

    The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}


    The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

    1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
    2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    Automatically (self invoked)
    3.We will learn a lot more about function invocation later in this tutorial.
